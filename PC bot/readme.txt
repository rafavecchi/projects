This project was made for fun.

In order to snowboard at Park City Resort in 2020-2021, they required a 
reservation to be made. Certain days were very difficult to get a reservation. 
This bot uses the selenium library and a chrome driver to go through the 
reservation process in their website in a loop, until an availability is 
presented and it successfully makes the reservation for me.
